# Escape King's Landing

A visual novel adventure game where you play as Ned Stark, transmigrated into his body right after Robert Baratheon's death. Your mission: navigate the treacherous political landscape of King's Landing and escape with your life and honor intact.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Escape King's Landing** is an interactive visual novel that puts you in the shoes of Eddard Stark during one of the most critical moments in Westeros history. After King Robert's death, you find yourself surrounded by enemies in the capital city. The Lannisters are closing in, and every decision matters.

### The Challenge

- **Survive**: Escape King's Landing before the Lannisters capture or kill you
- **Preserve Honor**: Make choices that align with Ned Stark's values while ensuring survival
- **Navigate Politics**: Interact with key characters like Cersei, Joffrey, Varys, and Littlefinger
- **Manage Resources**: Build alliances, gather information, and use your wits to escape

### Game Mechanics

- **Choice-Based Narrative**: Your decisions shape the story and determine your fate
- **Dynamic Storytelling**: AI-powered narrative generation creates unique experiences
- **Visual Scenes**: AI-generated images bring each scene to life
- **Character Relationships**: Track trust levels and threat levels of key characters
- **Multiple Endings**: Victory (escape) or Defeat (captured/killed)

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Story Generation**: Uses OpenAI GPT to create dynamic, branching narratives
- **AI-Generated Art**: Freepik API generates atmospheric scene images
- **Interactive Visual Novel Interface**: Immersive full-screen experience
- **Persistent Game Sessions**: Save your progress and continue your escape
- **Character Tracking**: Monitor relationships with key Game of Thrones characters
- **Risk Assessment**: Each choice has a risk level (low, medium, high)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for game sessions and state
- **SQLModel**: Database ORM
- **OpenAI API**: Narrative and art description generation
- **Freepik API**: Image generation

### Frontend
- **React 19**: Modern React with TypeScript
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerized development environment
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic reloading for both frontend and backend

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose)
- **Git**
- **API Keys**:
  - OpenAI API key (for narrative generation)
  - Freepik API key (for image generation)

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EvoNovel
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy this template and fill in your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FREEPIK_API_KEY=your_freepik_api_key_here
```

**Important**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed to git. Never commit your actual API keys to the repository.

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL images
- Start all services with hot reload enabled
- Expose services on:
  - **FastAPI**: http://localhost:8000
  - **React Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
  - **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432

### 4. Access the Game

- **Frontend**: Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (FastAPI Swagger UI)

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start a New Game**: Click "Begin Your Escape" on the start screen
2. **Read the Narrative**: Each scene presents your current situation
3. **Make Choices**: Select from 3-4 available actions, each with different risk levels
4. **Watch the Story Unfold**: Your choices determine what happens next
5. **Track Your Progress**: Monitor character relationships and key events
6. **Escape or Perish**: Reach the end and see if you successfully escaped King's Landing

### Strategy Tips

- **Low Risk**: Safer choices, but may take longer to escape
- **Medium Risk**: Balanced approach, moderate rewards
- **High Risk**: Dangerous but potentially faster routes to freedom
- **Build Alliances**: Trusting the right people can be crucial
- **Gather Information**: Knowledge is power in the game of thrones
- **Time Matters**: The game ends after 15 turns - escape before then!

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Game Endpoints

- `POST /api/game/start` - Start a new game session
- `POST /api/game/continue` - Continue game with a choice
- `POST /api/game/generate-art` - Generate art description for a scene
- `POST /api/game/generate-image` - Generate image from art description

### Utility Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /clickcount` - Get click count (demo endpoint)
- `GET /clickcount/increment` - Increment click count (demo endpoint)

## 🛠️ Development

### Hot Reload

Both services support hot reload:
- Changes to Python files in `fastApiServer/` automatically restart the FastAPI server
- Changes to React files in `reactClient/` automatically reload in the browser

### Restart Services

```bash
# Restart all services
docker-compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart fastapi
docker-compose restart react
```

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f fastapi
docker-compose logs -f react
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

### Stop the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove volumes (including PostgreSQL data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Rebuild After Dependency Changes

```bash
# For Python dependencies
docker-compose build fastapi

# For Node dependencies
docker-compose build react

# Rebuild everything
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🗄️ Database

### Access PostgreSQL

Open a `psql` session inside the running PostgreSQL container:

```bash
docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U postgres -d postgres
```

Once in `psql`:
- List databases: `\l`
- Switch database: `\c <database>`
- List tables: `\dt`
- Exit: `\q`

### Database Schema

The game uses SQLModel to manage:
- **GameSession**: Stores game state, narrative, and session information
- **ClickCount**: Demo table for tracking user interactions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If ports 8000, 5173, or 5432 are already in use, modify the host port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"  # Change host port (left side)
```

### Container Name Conflicts

If you see errors about container names already in use:

```bash
# Remove all containers
docker-compose down

# Or remove specific container
docker stop <container-name>
docker rm <container-name>
```

### API Key Issues

If you see errors about missing API keys:
1. Verify `.env` file exists in project root
2. Check that API keys are correctly set (no quotes, no extra spaces)
3. Restart containers: `docker-compose restart fastapi`

### Image Generation Fails

If images don't generate:
- Check Freepik API key is valid
- Check API quota/limits
- Images will show an error message but game continues without them

### Database Connection Issues

If PostgreSQL connection fails:
- Ensure PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`
- Restart: `docker-compose restart postgres`
