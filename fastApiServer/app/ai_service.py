Generate the consequence of this choice and the next scene. Return a JSON object with:
- narrative: 2-3 sentences describing what happens as a result of the choice and the new situation
- scene_setting: A brief location name (may be the same or different from previous)
- scene_changed: boolean indicating if the scene_setting changed
- choices: An array of 3-4 choice objects for the next turn (same format as before)
- characters: Updated array of character objects with trust_level and threat_level

Rules:
- Stay true to Game of Thrones setting
- Ned cannot use violence effectively
- Choices have logical consequences
- Game ends after 10-15 turns max
- Victory: Ned escapes King's Landing (location becomes "Outside King's Landing" or similar)
- Defeat: Ned is captured/killed
- Update character trust levels based on actions (range 0-10)
- Track key events that affect the story
- If game_over is true, choices should be empty array
- IMPORTANT: Generate NEW and DIFFERENT choices each turn based on the current situation
- Each choice ID must be unique (use descriptive names like "trust_varys", "confront_cersei", etc.)
- Choices should reflect the consequences of previous actions and the current narrative state
